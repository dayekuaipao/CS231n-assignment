# CS231n 2019 version

## Assignment 1:

### Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (20 points)

The IPython Notebook **knn.ipynb** will walk you through implementing the kNN classifier.

### Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine (25 points)

The IPython Notebook **svm.ipynb** will walk you through implementing the SVM classifier.

### Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier (20 points)

The IPython Notebook **softmax.ipynb** will walk you through implementing the Softmax classifier.

### Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network (25 points)
The IPython Notebook **two\_layer\_net.ipynb** will walk you through the implementation of a two-layer neural network classifier.

### Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features (10 points)

The IPython Notebook **features.ipynb** will walk you through this exercise, in which you will examine the improvements gained by using higher-level representations as opposed to using raw pixel values.

## Assignment 2:

### Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network (20 points)
The IPython notebook `FullyConnectedNets.ipynb` will introduce you to our
modular layer design, and then use those layers to implement fully-connected
networks of arbitrary depth. To optimize these models you will implement several
popular update rules.

### Q2: Batch Normalization (30 points)
In the IPython notebook `BatchNormalization.ipynb` you will implement batch
normalization, and use it to train deep fully-connected networks.

### Q3: Dropout (10 points)
The IPython notebook `Dropout.ipynb` will help you implement Dropout and explore
its effects on model generalization.

### Q4: Convolutional Networks (30 points)
In the IPython Notebook `ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb` you will implement several new layers that are commonly used in convolutional networks.

### Q5: PyTorch / TensorFlow on CIFAR-10 (10 points)
For this last part, you will be working in either TensorFlow or PyTorch, two popular and powerful deep learning frameworks. **You only need to complete ONE of these two notebooks.** You do NOT need to do both, and we will _not_ be awarding extra credit to those who do. 

Open up either `PyTorch.ipynb` or `TensorFlow.ipynb`. There, you will learn how the framework works, culminating in training a  convolutional network of your own design on CIFAR-10 to get the best performance you can.

## Assignment 3:

### Q1: Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs (25 points)
The Jupyter notebook `RNN_Captioning.ipynb` will walk you through the
implementation of an image captioning system on MS-COCO using vanilla recurrent
networks.

### Q2: Image Captioning with LSTMs (30 points)
The Jupyter notebook `LSTM_Captioning.ipynb` will walk you through the
implementation of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs, and apply them to image
captioning on MS-COCO.

### Q3: Network Visualization: Saliency maps, Class Visualization, and Fooling Images (15 points)
The Jupyter notebooks `NetworkVisualization-TensorFlow.ipynb` /`NetworkVisualization-PyTorch.ipynb` will introduce the pretrained SqueezeNet model, compute gradients
with respect to images, and use them to produce saliency maps and fooling
images. Please complete only one of the notebooks (TensorFlow or PyTorch). No extra credit will be awardeded if you complete both notebooks.

### Q4: Style Transfer (15 points)
In the Jupyter notebooks `StyleTransfer-TensorFlow.ipynb`/`StyleTransfer-PyTorch.ipynb` you will learn how to create images with the content of one image but the style of another. Please complete only one of the notebooks (TensorFlow or PyTorch). No extra credit will be awardeded if you complete both notebooks.

### Q5: Generative Adversarial Networks (15 points)
In the Jupyter notebooks `GANS-TensorFlow.ipynb`/`GANS-PyTorch.ipynb` you will learn how to generate images that match a training dataset, and use these models to improve classifier performance when training on a large amount of unlabeled data and a small amount of labeled data. Please complete only one of the notebooks (TensorFlow or PyTorch). No extra credit will be awarded if you complete both notebooks.
